<h2>What do we do?</h2>

TAP aims to provide you with the latest insights in the pipeline industry, and how politics and international relations control chunks of metal between countries!
<br><br>
We regularly publish legal articles analyzing the major issues in the pipeline world, while making the information accessible to those from a non-law background as well. 
<br><br>
TAP is a great platform for law students to connect with the best related to the oil and gas sector.
