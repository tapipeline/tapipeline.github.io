# The Game Jam Survival Guide

![GJSK.jpeg]({{site.baseurl}}/_posts/GJSK.jpeg)

Game Jams may not be edible but they sure are delicious experiences. Christer Kaitila tries to distill that experience into a more palatable form for the ones who are hungry to get some jam. This article is mostly about structuring the tips and tricks in a easily comprehensible manner but I’ll try to include some of my personal viewpoints from my experience of jams as well. The book is a valuable resource for anyone interested in game development and I will definitely recommend the book to anyone wanting to get feet wet in game jams.

So, you have a game jam in a few days, how do you prepare yourself and your tools so that there are as few as possible catastrophes on the days of the event? Try this checklist

    Prepare your tools: Tools refer to everything from base code, art tools (understanding the workflow) and audio tools (along with libraries).
    Form a team / network with others: Depending upon the type of jam try meeting up and discussing your games with other people to make the game jam experience a more fulfilling one.
    Avoid:
        Tools you aren’t familiar with
        Sleep deprivation
        Unhealthy eating
        Ignoring social responsibilities
        Ignoring relationships (May sound like overstating the obvious but it’s important)


Once you got everything set up for your big weekend, what next? The next chapter introduces some of the basic ways to define the game you are going to make and appropriately scope it. Some tips for narrowing down game ideas based on research from a lot of game postmortems are as follows:

    Keeping art styles and levels simple and/or derived. Game art creation is one of the key causes of failures in game jams.
    Sound although often overlooked can add a lot of depth and finesse to the game.
    Seek inspiration for game ideas from all sources in a relaxed mood. Be ready to let go of ideas that maybe very mainstream or out of scope.
    Have a plan for the jam but don’t waste too much time elaborating it. A good way of approaching the problem is properly defining the game and then coming up with broad activities that need to be done to finish and polish the game within time.
    Using paper prototypes is thoroughly encouraged as it helps understand the mechanics and gameplay better.
    A way of approaching games is to create a fake screenshot of a game and then derive components from that image.
    Don’t stress about making your game beautiful, focus on making it happen.
    Avoid the latest fad- go low tech. Remember that constraints lead to creativity.

 

The book then talks about how to dive deeper into your game while not feeling demotivated. It addresses the long problem of staying motivated when things don’t go as planned and having an optimal jamming experience.

    One way to force yourself not to give up when you’re feeling down and out is to take a break. Get some fresh air and approach the problem from a different angle after getting your mind off things for a while.
    A great motivational tool is posting screenshots of the work in progress. Sharing your work with others (your fellow jammers, Twitter, your blog, and so on) will generate feedback and encouragement.
    Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Show off your hard work. Encourage others and test their games, too. You’ll find that whatever you give is what you’ll get. If you encourage your fellow competitors, they’ll do the same for you.

 
 

The next chapter ‘Breaking Through the Wall’ as the name suggests is all about breaking walls of conventional wisdom to finish the game simple, on time and with enough iterations to make it awesome. Some key concepts discussed are as follows:

    Keep It Simple, Stupid!
    Have a no-art gameplay proof-of-concept.
    Distill to the essential features.
    Finishing a “working” basic prototype early.
    Avoid Occam’s Razor (Adding a lot of extra features that lead to more changes of failure).
    Break the rules of computer science (Work on fast and working code instead of beautifully written code).
    Avoid common mistakes by treating yourself well and scoping down the game to its bare skeleton.
    Procedural generation can flesh out a lot more levels than handcrafting them and should be seen as a potential option.
    Keep iterating the prototype to find the fun.
    FIRST make it work, THEN make it pretty.

  

As you approach the finish line there will be severe burnout, fatal bugs to fix and the hanging dread of not being able to finish the game. In times like these the most important thing to understand is that Jams are learning opportunities and one should focus on learning more than stressing about the game. Here are a few tips to finish the jam in style, with a smile.

    Real life is more important, take a break if you need to.
    If you can’t finish the game don’t let your pride stop you from submitting whatever you were able to accomplish.
    Chop out the bad parts: “Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to remove”
    Heinous hacks and ugly code are all right and often encouraged.
    Polish, polish, polish. Polish is the key my friend.
    Letting players try out your game without giving them any verbal instructions can be a great technique to see if the game is as self-explanatory as you may think it is.
    Don’t forget to set aside time to package the game.
    The game’s name is IMPORTANT. Short and descriptive names are the way to go.
    The game’s description is IMPORTANT. This text is absolutely essential and will affect your rankings.
    The game’s thumbnail is IMPORTANT. A punchy image or character that gives players an indication of what the game is all about is a better option than a screenshot of the gameplay.

 

Now that you have finished your game, what next? The next chapter is about common activities that one can do to learn the most out of the experience.

    Play the games made by other jammers and vote for your favorites.
    Write a post mortem analysis of the game to understand key successes and failures of the game.
    Plan and expand the game to send it to Sponsors, portals, and app stores.

 

Congratulations, you made it :’) . Your next jam awaits you.
