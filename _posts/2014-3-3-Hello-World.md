The [A]political Pipeline is an international forum for dialogue and reflection on how the major pipelines in the world have a significant influence on international affairs and international law. We provide maritime news and blogs. We also post international, and a few select national fellowships, internships, calls for papers, and much more for students who want international exposure!
