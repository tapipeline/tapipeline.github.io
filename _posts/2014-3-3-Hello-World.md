## Why blog in 2021? Can't you just make reels and aesthetic images like the rest of us?

I actually tried making reels but there's a glaring problem: I am awkward. But I did have a lot of thoughts that I just wanted to document somewhere and a blog seems like one of the things that would also help me become better at writing and articulating my thoughts.

## What would you even write about?

I intend to write upon things that excite me, that make me think and everything in between. For starters I want to write on caste, on game development, on my life and experiences and about memes.

## Why should I read  your blog?

Maybe you'll like it, maybe you'll hate it or worse maybe you'll have no feelings about it. Either way you might come across new ideas and who knows, maybe you'll develop on those ideas and change the world.

## How many posts a week?

I'm pledging 2 a week, what I deliver we'll both have to see.
